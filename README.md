# Online Mobile Shop
_Simple website for mobile trading_

***

This Project is coded by vanilla PHP. It is just a try to understand
how (MVC) frameworks behave behind the scene, and for this reason; I
tried to build a small website that would support (CRUD) API with many
view pages, punch of controllers, and “Route” class to link the project
sections. This website uses (Bootstrap) as a front-end framework to make
my designs responsive as possible. The DBMS that I have used in this
project is (MySQL V5.0.1).

**Configuration:**
1. Start making your database using _project.sql_ , this file has many SQL instructions to create your database schema and insert some data inside of it.
  * Note: i use PHPMyAdmin to create this stuff, do whatever you want :)
   
2.The _main file_ to run this project is **src/index.php**.
  * I usually use PHP command line to run the server `php -S localhost:8000` in **src/ folder**.
  * You can use a web server and put this project in **htdocs path** if you want.

## What's Next!!

I know this project is so simple and maybe in the future, there will be a punch of improvements to many stuff.
